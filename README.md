# What is the project? 
*	The project is about implementing a **Gossip Protocol**.
*	The main functionalities of the project :
	* **Introduction** : Each new peer contacts a well-known peer (the introducer) to join the group. 
	* **Membership** : A membership protocol satisfies completeness all the time (for joins and failures), and accuracy when there are no message delays or losses (high accuracy when there are losses or delays).
